								<h2>ICT</h2>
							</header>

							<p>The infrastructure and components that enable contemporary computing are known as ICT (information and communications technology). used to refer to a fuller, more complete list of all computer and digital technology components than IT. The list of ICT components is extensive, and it is continually growing. Computers and telephones, for example, have been around for decades. 
								Others are newer additions, such as cellphones, digital televisions, and robotics.
								ICT, on the other hand, usually refers to more than a list of components. It also includes the implementation of all of those different components. It is here that ICT's true potential, power, and danger may be discovered..</p>

								<h2>Ict Benefits</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/about-ict-applications.png" alt="" /></a>

							<p>Economic, social, and interpersonal transactions and exchanges are all facilitated by ICT. People's working, 
								communicating, learning, and living styles have all altered dramatically as a result of information and communication technology. Furthermore, 
								ICT continues to alter many aspects of human life, as computers and now robots do many of the duties previously performed by people. For example, 
								computers used to answer phones and direct calls to the proper personnel to react; currently, robots can not only answer calls, but they can also fulfill callers' service needs more swiftly and effectively.
								ICT's contribution to economic development and corporate expansion has been so significant that it has been credited with ushering in what has been dubbed the Fourth Industrial Revolution by many..</p>

								<p>ICT also drives societal transformations, as people move away from personal, face-to-face contacts and toward digital connections. The Digital Age is a word used to describe this new age.

									The World Bank has released some conclusions. It was reported in 2016 that more than 75% of the world's population had access to a cellphone. However, due to a lack of ICT infrastructure, internet connection by mobile or fixed Broadband remains prohibitively expensive in many nations.
									
									These diverse institutions say that individuals who lack ICT skills are excluded from the numerous chances and advantages that ICT provides, and will hence fall farther behind in terms of socioeconomic development.</p>

							<p> introduced before to the 1980s and is often not connected to computers nowadays. In this chapter, Â We will concentrate on the most current developments in ICT and so limit our analysis to technologies related to computers and communications. This is the phase of the microelectronic revolution that is technologically active. Our approach emphasizes ICT's ability to analyze data in ways that are similar to human intellect and intelligence, and therefore its ability to boost labor productivity in a mostly service economy.</p>

							<p>Furthermore, ICT has a significant influence on our daily life. For example, we may use the internet newspaper to read our local newspaper. Another example is that even if we are overseas, we may still communicate with our family, relatives, or coworkers via electronic mail, yahoo messenger, phone conference, or video conference. Because of ICT, our economic idea has shifted from a time and space bound economy to a time and space bound economy. It provides several benefits for economic development by facilitating millions of transactions in a simple and timely manner.</p>

							<p>In addition, ICT has a huge impact on our daily lives. For example, we may read our local newspaper using the online newspaper. Another example is that we can contact with our family, relatives, or coworkers by e-mail, yahoo messenger, phone conference, or video conference even if we are overseas. Our economic concept has moved from a time and space confined economy to a time and space bound economy as a result of ICT. It facilitates millions of transactions in a simple and quick manner, which has various advantages for economic development.</p>
